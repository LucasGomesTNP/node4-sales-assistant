# Jisc
Jisc is a not for profit organisation that provides technology solutions and services for the UK’s education and research sectors.

Jisc is best known for its Janet network, which is used by approximately 18 million people across the UK for research and education.


## The Challenge

In 2018, Jisc upgraded its core finance system to a solution based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. “We needed to be able to access more system functionality than our existing configuration allowed,” recalls Anne Marie Gregory, Jisc’s Director of Finance Transformation. “. We were unable to access some core solution functionality and had to continue with many manual processes that we thought could be automated. It was a very frustrating time for us as we weren’t where we wanted to be.”

*Jist problems*
- Limited Access
- Lack of Automation
- Low Functionality
- Security at Scale needed


She continues: “But the biggest issue was that our configuration was using a single-entity ledger, even though Jisc is a multi-entity organisation. This fundamental element was key to our decision to reimplement the solution entirely. At that point, we put out a tender, which Node4 won, standing out from the crowd regarding their detailed, considered response. We were particularly impressed with Node4’s data security knowledge. This was particularly relevant to us, as our security infrastructure is of utmost importance.”  



## The Solution

As a top priority, Node4 fully integrated Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations with one of Jisc’s other IT systems. This enabled the solution to operate—as intended—as a unified platform that can automate operations, enhance decision making and drive growth.

Following the reimplementation, the solution also provides Jisc with the appropriate multi-entity structure to facilitate recording all financial transactions for each legal entity in the group. In addition, it simplifies sales invoicing and payment processes, provides appropriate internal and external visibility of customer account transactions and reduces the need for time-consuming manual searches.

“We can now run automated daily bank reconciliations,” says Anne Marie. “We have reduced our debtor days and can now supply our credit control team with more timely information, empowering them to do their job more effectively. Our month-end reporting is much more efficient, too, as we can report directly from the system rather than depending on third-party generated reports. Overall, we’re much more confident about the accuracy of our automated reports—particularly the most complex inter-company ones.”  

## The Results

- More Effiecient
The new system’s accessibility significantly enhances data management efficiency across the organisation. Users can easily input and extract data from the application, regardless of their location, allowing more time for analysis and making critical, real-time decisions based on the insights gained.

- More control
With functions moved over from third-party software, Jisc has more control over its data and reporting structure along with unified training for all tools with less exposure to cybersecurity threats.

- Time-saving reduction
A task which would have typically taken days has now been reduced to minutes thanks to new abilities to automate manual tasks. Employees can now create faster and more accurate reports instantly with PowerBi.

# Stephensons

Based in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and operating since 1868, Stephensons is a fifth-generation, family-run supplier to the catering and hospitality sectors — including restaurants, pubs and hotels. It also supplies public sector organisations and a selection of schools, colleges and campuses.

Stephensons boasts the North of England’s largest cash and carry showroom and has a growing online presence. All local, regional, national and international orders are managed by a dedicated customer service team that operates out of the company’s Greater Manchester hub. 


## The Challenge

Stephensons relied on an on-premises ISDN/PSTN telephony and call centre system. Nearing end-of-life, it impacted contact centre performance, led to frustrated customers and contributed to a stressful working environment. An alternative solution was needed, one that could boost agent responsiveness, enable agents to deal with more customers, reduce dropped call numbers and allow more orders to be taken — all while improving customer service levels.

Chris North, Customer Service and Cash and Carry Manager at Stephensons, remembers what it was like in those days: “Calls would ring on every free agent’s phone. But if the whole team were already talking to customers, the phones would ring throughout the building. With 300-400 calls each day, it felt like there was constant ringing everywhere, which was really stressful. It meant long waiting times for customers. It was also more likely that the person who finally answered could only take a message and offer a callback. Unfortunately, these callbacks rarely happened as the agents were so busy. It was frustrating for customers — and we suffered a lot of negative online reviews as a result.”

## The Solution 

Stephensons’ owners knew the contact centre needed a complete overhaul, and Chris was tasked with finding a new solution. “We wanted an omnichannel contact centre that would open up new ways for customers to connect with us, and we wanted visibility on vital call and performance metrics. But beyond that, we had no preconceived ideas about which vendor or solution we should choose,” he recalls.

Chris ultimately selected Cisco’s Webex Calling phone system and Webex Contact Center offerings. He also chose Webex Video Conferencing for internal use between teams and office locations. This meant Stephensons would be moving from a difficult-to-manage on-premises infrastructure to a simplified, agile and scalable cloud-based solution — one that would be far more responsive to changing business needs.     

He explains: “Cisco’s representatives connected me with Node4 because of the company’s status as a Webex Calling Service Provider and Premier Certified Cisco Partner. This would prove invaluable as the project gathered pace — fast-tracking many stages and making my life far more simple. It also helped greatly when we wanted to add functionality that wasn’t available out of the box.”.


## The Results

- Enhanced insight and boosted efficiency 
- Detailed performance analytics
- More communication channels for customers
- Improved customer service and satisfaction

### Contact centre analytics and KPIs
Stephensons’ new Webex-powered contact centre delivers the detailed performance analytics that Chris and the management were so keen to see. This includes the number of calls dropped each day, average call length, average time taken to answer a call, and agent-by-agent call handling performance. “We can also see how many customers we need to call back and ensure we call them back the same day,” he comments. 


### Improved Efficiency

The insight gained from new analytics makes Stephensons’ contact centre far more efficient. It also allows Chris to see where and when there’s redundancy in the system. These factors mean that if an agent is on holiday, off sick, or has left the business, Chris can assess whether the remainder of the team can cover the calls or need extra help.

“Just before Christmas, a colleague moved to another department,” Chris recounts. “I decided against hiring as it was so close to our peak season, and we wouldn’t have been able to train them in time. But we got through Christmas without noticing any impact. In fact, we broke our sales record in November and December while maintaining customer service standards and hitting call-handling KPIs! What’s more, we may well be able to go forward without making that hire, which will save the business a significant amount of money.”

### Omnichannel communications
Following Node4’s upgrade of Stephensons’ contact centre, customers can chat with agents via WhatsApp, Webchat, text message, and Facebook Messenger. “I can’t overstate the importance of this,” explains Chris. “The way our customers want to engage with us is changing. Hospitality managers want to reach us via instant messaging more often these days and place their orders on the go. They don’t always want or need to speak to someone on the phone. I think it suits the fast pace and more relaxed approach many have got used to with services like Uber, Just Eat and Airbnb. If we didn’t have those channels available, I know they would have gone elsewhere by now.”

### IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE

Summing up his experience, Chris recalls that the situation today couldn’t be more different from those difficult early days: “When I first started, the call centre was a stressful place. It was hard to be proactive and deliver the kind of customer service we aspired to. With Node4’s help, we’ve created a contact centre environment where agents feel empowered to take more time with customers and make them feel valued. As a result, we’re getting lots of five-star reviews congratulating us on our excellent customer service. Customers still feel like they’re getting that small business care and attention even though we’re taking more orders and calls than ever.”

He concludes: “I’m no longer dealing with negative customer feedback, which gives me the headspace to think longer term about further improvements and enhancements — more ways to make things even better for our business and ensure the contact centre is playing its part in supporting business growth. I’ve no doubt that this turnaround is down to Node4’s strong product and technical knowledge — and their ability to help us get the very best from our Webex solution.”



# WARWICKSHIRE police force

After Brexit, UK police forces lost access to the Schengen Information System (SIS II). They returned to using INTERPOL’s I 24/7 database, which they accessed either through the National Crime Agency (NCA) or an existing desktop system. This limited their capability to run criminal, missing person, and persons of interest searches on EU citizens while away from the station.  

From April 2024, police forces were required to provide frontline officers with mobile access to key data from I 24/7 via the International Law Enforcement Alerts Platform, or I-LEAP. This would deliver mobile access to names, vehicle details and selected documents—making it quicker and easier for officers to conduct roadside and other remote checks.  

“I-LEAP adoption was reasonably straightforward for forces with mobile-enabled Police National Computer search capabilities,” explains Head of Change, Nicholas Clarke at Warwickshire Police. “All they had to do was integrate it into their systems and processes and carry on as normal.”  

He continues, “But Warwickshire Police didn’t have these capabilities. So, as the deadline approached, officers continued to radio the control room and request I-24/7 searches. There were a lot of steps to the process, so it could take a few minutes to get the necessary information.” 

## The Challenge

TO BUY OR TO BUILD?  

Nicholas Clarke admits this was not ideal: “At the end of the day, we knew we would either have to buy a solution to provide officers with direct, real-time mobile I-LEAP access or build one ourselves. And, since a third-party solution would have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, it made more financial and operational sense to build it ourselves.”   

To give further context to the decision, it’s worth taking a step back and looking at Warwickshire Police’s approach to technology: “We’re the UK’s smallest county force,” explains Nicholas Clarke. “That can present some challenges, but it also allows us to be more agile and innovate faster than some larger forces.”  

“We have a mature technology change programme and our own in-house PowerApp developer team,” he comments, “We were already very much invested in Microsoft’s ecosystem and had built several PowerApps when the I-LEAP directive was announced. Plus, we already had a long-standing relationship with Node4 to supply IT consultancy and third-party tech support.”   


## The solution 


### A SHARED VISION AND CLOSE COLLABORATION  

Taking these points into consideration, it made sense for Node4 and Warwickshire Police to design and develop a Power App that could put I-24/7 data directly into the hands of frontline officers. “We worked closely together and Node4’s team became part of our own development team. It was always a two-way conversation, with Node4 on hand to answer queries and guide us during the testing and roll-out stages,” Nicholas Clarke comments.   

He continues: “There were many instances where it was easier for us if Node4 could demo new app functionality in person rather than try to explain it in an email or on a Teams call. Node4’s team always obliged and made the time to visit us on-site. This kept the project on track and prevented potential misunderstandings. Now that our I-LEAP app has been rolled out, Node4 provides round-the-clock support when needed.”  

### THE I-LEAP SEARCH APPLICATION—A UNIQUE MICROSOFT POWERAPP USE CASE 

Nicolas Clarke recalls that the entire app development approach was unique and groundbreaking. Warwickshire Police  I-LEAP Search Application is the first to use Microsoft’s PowerApps platform and the first designed specifically for mobile devices.

## Results

“The project has been a success because we all shared the same vision and purpose,” Nicholas Clarke notes. “The I-LEAP Search Application is fast, and the search results are almost instant. It’s easy and intuitive to use, with a look and feel resembling standard website navigation. All information links are clickable, so officers can drill down into the data and fully appraise themselves of the situation. As you might expect, it also meets required security standards,  although I can’t go into too much detail here for obvious reasons.” 

"I think we’ve created something new and unique that could also benefit other police forces," Nicholas Clarke comments. "But it’s important for anyone considering going down this route to check their Power App and Azure licenses and associated costs."

He concludes: “Our solution uses a broader Microsoft infrastructure that does come at a cost—but it made sense for us given our previous investment in the PowerApps platform and Microsoft infrastructure. If those conditions are met, then I could definitely see the I-LEAP Search Application being templated and rolled out to other police forces.”

# ESSEX COUNTY FIRE & RESCUE SERVICE

As one of the largest fire and rescue services in the UK, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service provide prevention, protection and response services from fifty fire stations across Essex. The service covers an area of 1,4000 square miles and helps protect the county’s 1.8 million population. With Essex being a county of contrasts, the force responds to a variety of needs from their residents. 

## The challenge

In line with the UK Government’s cloud-first agenda, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service were keen to migrate as much of its server and application infrastructure to Microsoft Azure with the aim of reducing costs and simplifying disaster recovery processes. 

To ensure they were getting the most from migrating to the cloud, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service engaged early with Risual, a Node4 Company, for a vision and scoping engagement. This engagement focused on the full end-user computing transformation to help them understand the benefits of Azure, as well as moving key productivity workloads to Office 365. 

After completing their vision for longer-term aims, the service knew that the agility they were looking to achieve relied on a reliable data centre environment (using the best of Microsoft Cloud) that integrated with on-premises capabilities where appropriate. However, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service were looking to undertake a cloud application analysis to help them fully understand how their move to Azure would help bring the agility and cost savings they required. 


## The Solution

he cloud application analysis is a short engagement where a Business Analyst from Node4 is tasked with uncovering all applications used by Essex County Fire and Rescue service, as well as identifying where they’re hosted and providing recommendations on migrating them to the cloud. 

“The first thing we realised upon agreeing the engagement was that we didn’t have a definitive list of all our applications, we had departmental silos where departments were using applications without IT knowing exactly who was paying for or supporting it.” 

Dennis Leeks, ICT Programme Manager at Essex County Fire and Rescue Service 

To collate the required information, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service ran projects to establish secure communication links as well as setting up a virtual datacentre in Azure that was ready to migrate applications and services onto. risual ensured that these workstreams ran efficiently as well as managing project interdependencies. 

After collating the relevant information, a migration roadmap was created to highlight the steps towards cloud migration as well as ensuring alignment to their business goals. 

## The results

- Definitive application catalogue
- Cost control of application services 
- SQL database server consolidation 
- Efficient test and development environments 

The cloud application analysis allowed Essex County Fire and Rescue Service to build the foundations towards cloud migration. They now have a definitive application catalogue as well as Digital Application Passports to allow further analysis and a clear view of their application estate. 

A Power BI dashboard was provided to allow the service to interrogate the data in their application catalogue, providing recommendations and guiding decisions on which applications to migrate and when, as well as a clear cost of providing application services. 

Essex County Fire and Rescue Service have also been able to consolidate their SQL database servers – this provides an opportunity to reduce licensing costs as only one SQL database is required to run multiple applications. Using PAAS (platform as a service) further reduces the total cost of ownership of test and development environments. Essex County Fire and Rescue Service can now be more efficient when using their test and development environments, as they’re able to build a more secure and well-run environment that runs when needed. 

“Migrating to the cloud will provide consolidation of the SQL database servers – we have around 30 database servers which we can rationalise and allow one SQL database server for multiple applications, which allows us to reduce licensing costs and increase efficiency” 


## ARROWXL

With over 25 years of experience, ArrowXL is the UK’s largest and longest-established two-person delivery and warehousing specialist.


Headquartered in Wigan, the company focuses on delivering large, heavy and unwieldy orders such as sofas, domestic appliances and gym equipment.


It also offers additional value-add services, including appliance fitting, furniture assembly and removal of old items.

## The Challenge
inding a replacement for unreliable, outdated network connectivity and IT security infrastructure
ArrowXL places exceptional service at the centre of all its operations, ensuring deliveries are made on time and with minimal disruption to customers. This requires fast, reliable and secure IT across the company’s distribution network.


So, when ArrowXL’s multi-site network began to suffer sustained outages and the incumbent supplier breached SLAs, it was time to take action. 

## The Solution
**Secure SD-WAN and renewed structured cabling**


After looking at several competing solutions, the decision was taken to roll out Node4’s fully managed Secure SD-WAN across eight sites and replace the structured cabling, comms cabinets and access points. This infrastructure would help provide improved connectivity indoors and outdoors for each location. Rachel Hopkins, Chief Information Officer at ArrowXL, explains: “Right from the outset, there was a high degree of consensus about choosing Node4’s Secure SD-WAN. Node4’s bid team demonstrated the solution’s superior speed, versatility and security very clearly. They also made a compelling case for how their additional services and solutions could add further value to the business in the future.”


With the initial phase of the SD-WAN rollout completed, Rachel and her team turned their attention to sourcing and implementing a managed threat and detect service. She takes up the story: “Node4 was our incumbent network and data centre provider by this stage, so partnering with them to deliver further security-related services enabled a much more responsive proposition. However, to ensure best value, we approached several other potential providers during the procurement process. 


Rachel continues: “Ultimately, we chose Threat Detect, Node4’s Security Operations Centre service — or SOC. We were particularly impressed by the solution’s use of the latest AI technology and third-party intelligence sources. But the real added value for us came from the fact that our network would be monitored round the clock by Node4’s team of expert security analysts — which removed the need for us to hire an Information Security team.


## The Results

- Secure SD-WAN and renewed structured cabling
- Managed Threat and Detect Service
- Enhanced IT Security with 24/7 capability

### An IT network that delivers on its promises

Today, Node4’s Secure SD-WAN forms the backbone of ArrowXL’s network technology. Its centralised provisioning, consistent performance, network traffic visibility and ease of deployment have played a pivotal role in ensuring that deliveries happen on time and with minimal stress for customers, warehouse personnel and drivers. No matter when and where there are spikes in usage, Node4’s SD-WAN can adapt and maintain network speeds — ensuring the system is not overloaded and does not crash. The solution also features a next-generation firewall at each location to protect users from internal and external cyber threats.

“Node4’s Secure SD-WAN provides us with a faster, more robust IT network that, to date, hasn’t experienced any significant outages,” explains Rachel. “There’s no doubt that this leading-edge technology has delivered significant benefits to our business. We now have a resilient network that spans all our main locations, with plans to roll it out to all our outbases.”

She continues: “We expect to see further longer-term benefits as ArrowXL continues to evolve and grow. Node4’s SD-WAN will enable us to manage that change, allowing us to add or remove sites as necessary. It means we can be more flexible, adaptable and agile in our approach.”


### Enhanced IT security

Within two weeks of mobilisation, the SOC had already demonstrated its worth — identifying and isolating several accounts targeted by cyber criminals. It confirmed Rachel’s belief that taking a managed service approach to security was the correct choice. To hire a suitably qualified manager plus several analysts to provide the 24-hour coverage required would cost significantly more than using the Node4 managed threat and detect service and wouldn’t deliver an equivalent service.

She explains: “Our sector has suffered an increasing number of cyber attacks in recent months, so it’s an incredible relief to know we have that skill on tap to neutralise these threats when they present themselves.”

Rachel continues: “With Node4’s SOC solution in place, it’s really brought home just how little sense it would have made for an organisation of our size to try and deliver its own 24/7 capability — particularly in the context of having to attract and retain a team with these highly sought after skills — and why it was such a sensible choice to take a managed services approach.”


### A trusted, long-term IT partner

Taking stock, Rachel explains that Node4 has made a substantial contribution to ArrowXL’s IT infrastructure and information security — and that, today, the company also plays a vital role in providing advice and consultancy on future projects. Rachel notes: “Our partnership with Node4 is so important because we have a relatively small in-house IT team. They supplement our skills, knowledge and expertise in specialisms we’d be unable to attract and retain.”

She concludes: “They’re not afraid to talk about new technology and help us drive innovation — just as they did when proposing the SD-WAN and the managed service security offering. That’s why I see Node4 as an extension of my team — and much, much more than a service provider. It’s a partnership that will only strengthen as we embark on more IT infrastructure improvements over the coming months and years.”



# Essex County Council

Essex County Council governs the non-metropolitan county of Essex and is one of the largest local authorities in England.

As a non-metropolitan county council, Essex provides residents across the region with social care, education, libraries, transport, planning, waste disposal and leisure services, and shares responsibility with district and civil parish councils.

## The Challenge
Under the Data Protection Act 2018, people have a legal right to request access to any information held about them. Responding to subject access requests (SARs) can be time-consuming, and there could be thousands of documents that need to be shared in response to a single SAR. As a result, it’s important for councils around the UK to have a robust process in place for streamlined management of such requests.

Heavily reliant on a Microsoft Access database to support their internal SAR process, Essex County Council identified the need for a more modern, platform-based approach. With Microsoft technology already utilised across the organisation – and with plans to introduce Microsoft tech to support further areas of business – the team at Essex found themselves eager to adopt a Microsoft solution to help simplify and speed up their response to SARs.

Lauri Almond, Information Governance Manager at Essex County Council, said: “Responding to subject access requests can be a huge drain on our team’s time, especially given that we have deadlines to meet when issuing responses. Our existing system for handling SARs was developed internally, and while it still worked, it felt like the right time to start making the most of Microsoft tech and the efficiencies it can drive.”


## The Solution


When someone submits a SAR, the Essex team have to gain that individual’s ID and proof of consent, before gathering all relevant information from any number of disparate systems. After quality control is complete, documents are volumised for easier reading, and a response must be prepared and issued. Collating data and responding to an SAR can take the team at Essex up to 90 days, and they support the SAR process for schools and other local services, as well as handling SARs submitted directly to them in relation to the information they hold.

After carrying out a formalised procurement process, Essex appointed Tisski, a Node4 company as their partner of choice after the Microsoft Solutions Partner presented them with a viable way forward; the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service and an accelerator customised to meet their compliance needs would boost reliability and reduce the amount of time taken to respond to SARs.


## The Results



In turning to Microsoft technology to support this entire process, any team member faced with the responsibility of handling a SAR will be walked through the process step by step. With each stage of the SAR housed in a single, centralised platform – and SharePoint integration enabling documents and volumes to be viewed and stored in a consolidated system – Essex County Council can drastically reduce the administrative burden on their team by eliminating the need to dart between multiple platforms to gather and issue information.

“It’s been a pleasure to work closely with the team on a solution that really helps us enhance the way we handle these access requests,” Lauri said.

Dan Coupland, Sales Director at Node4 said: “We’re experienced in supporting local councils and there’s one thing that crops up time and time again: that desire to really drive efficiency and gain value for money in a shorter space of time.

“Working with the team at Essex County Council, we’ve not only delivered Dynamics Customer Service, but a specially configured accelerator that helps them overcome challenges they’ve faced with their access request process. Ultimately, the implementation of this new technology will save them time and resource, helping the team work faster and more effectively to manage this process and focus the time they save elsewhere.

“At Node4, we’re well-equipped to help local councils drive efficiencies like the ones showcased here with Essex and experienced in supporting the transition, from discovery, right the way through to implementation. It’s been a pleasure to play a part in that journey for the team at Essex, and we look forward to hearing about the impact this change has on their way of working.”



# West Midlands TRAINS

West Midlands Trains is owned by Transport UK. Operating London Northwestern Railway and West Midlands Railway franchises, it runs over 1,300 services to and from some of the UK’s busiest and most well-known stations, including Liverpool Lime Street, London Euston and Birmingham New Street.

“With less than a dozen staff, West Midlands Trains has a relatively small IT team but an extensive remit and heavy responsibilities,” explains Steve Roberts, Head of Information Technology, West Midlands Trains. “We maintain a vast distributed IT infrastructure that covers ticket machines, customer information screens, CCTV, help points, IoT sensors, back office systems and applications. To give you a sense of scale, we operate from 160 stations. The smallest ones have around 20-30 IT assets, while our largest sites can have up to 800. We have to maintain data centre connectivity for each site and each asset — and provide them all with reliable connectivity.” 


## The Challenge

Before engaging Node4, West Midlands Trains had three data centres. One provided centralised internet connectivity and disaster recovery, one housed the production servers that supported all the IT assets, and one contained all the network interconnectivity infrastructure to 3rd parties.  

“The Birmingham data centre was located within our HQ building. It was a purpose-built space with cooling and fire suppression but no backup power,” Steve Roberts recalls. “A few years ago, the building suffered a major electrical fault, and we — alongside all the other building’s tenants — lost our electricity supply for around five hours. Relying on an external generator, we recovered quickly and with no significant impact on train services. But the incident fast-tracked our decision to move the servers to a managed data centre with the latest security, backup, disaster recovery and redundancy capabilities.”

Steve and his team originally planned to move the servers — and the network infrastructure — to the same managed data centre that provided the organisation’s interconnectivity infrastructure. However, he was unhappy with the delays he’d experienced when the site was first brought online and the subsequent poor customer service. No longer confident in the provider’s capabilities, Steve spoke to his counterpart at East Midlands Railway to find out which company they had used after their recent successful data centre migration.


## The Solution

“My colleague told me they’d chosen a Midlands-based company called Node4. This was music to our ears as we wanted a data centre within an hour’s drive from Birmingham,” comments Steve. “When we looked further into Node4’s credentials, we found the company had great references from other rail operators and public transport companies too. Additionally, their data centres run on 100% renewable energy, which is good to know from an ESG and sustainability point of view. Spurred on, and with growing optimism, I arranged a site visit.”

Impressed with the company’s positive attitude, cultural similarities, and modern facilities, Steve changed his plans and decided to migrate all one hundred of West Midlands Trains’ servers to Node4’s main data centre. Today, that data centre also houses the train operator’s perimeter firewall, provides the base for its centralised internet connectivity and is the origin point for all site-to-site VPNs. To ensure availability and redundancy, the servers are backed up to one of Node4’s secondary data centres with auto-failover in place. These are connected by two independent internet links delivered by different telco providers.

“Node4 is integral to our organisation,” Steve explains. “Its data centre supports our commercial operations — enabling customers to buy tickets from ticket vending machines or station ticket office counters — as well as our customer information and safety infrastructure. Importantly, it also houses the rail operation and train management systems that ensure drivers, crews and services are in the right place at the right time.” 

## The Results

### A fast and well-planned data centre migration

There was a relatively small window to move the servers from the organisation’s HQ to Node4’s data centre. The last West Midland Trains service enters the depot at approximately 1am, and the first one departs at around 4am. Literally, every second would count.  

Steve recalls Node4’s meticulous preparation in the days before the move: “We got the network infrastructure and perimeter firewall up and running — and tested the failover — in advance. On the actual night, we shut down non-critical servers at 11pm and were given the approval from rail control to shut down the critical servers at midnight. All the servers were wrapped and transported from the Birmingham location to the Node4 data centre where they were unloaded and racked with connected power cables by 2am. Our business critical servers were back online at 4am and non-critical ones by 6am. I don’t think I'll ever forget the pressure we were under that night, but Node4’s team were professional, calm and exacting in their approach at each stage. As a result, everything went according to plan.”


### Precision project management to hit migration targets

“Node4’s team took on an important project management role right from the start,” Steve comments. “Too often you hear of spiralling data centre migration costs, which are often due to poor planning and execution. This was not the case with Node4 — they worked behind the scenes to keep the two internet providers on track, ensuring the links between the primary and secondary data centres were installed as scheduled.”


### Excellent onsite support, customer service and positive attitude
Steve also notes the incredible contrast in onsite support and general customer service compared to his previous data centre provider. “Node4’s data centre ‘hands and eyes’ service is just so helpful and obliging. If a drive fails in a server, I can log a ticket, ask Node4 to check it, send a part if necessary, and Node4 will fit it for me.”

He concludes: “This is part of Node4’s wider can-do attitude that we’d all recognised at that initial site visit. It proved I was right. We did indeed all hold ourselves to the same high standards and accountability. So instead of putting up barriers, causing delays and becoming a bottleneck, Node4 finds solutions, solves problems, and generally makes my life so much easier. It’s an absolute pleasure to work together.”


# East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service

East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service (ESFRS) provide prevention, protection and response services within East Sussex and the City of Brighton and Hove ­­– this extends to over eight hundred thousand people, covering both urbanised and rural locations.

These vital services aim to prevent loss of life and injury within the community, as well as help protect local buildings and the environment.

ESFRS are able to achieve this by working alongside other emergency service partners to respond efficiently to a range of emergencies, alongside delivering educational programmes, safety events, and prevention campaigns.


## The Challenge
As part of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, a key activity for ESFRS is to perform site familiarisation visits and exercises on premises which pose a higher risk to firefighters; these are called site-specific risk information (SSRI). Certain buildings carry a higher risk in the event of fire, these range from high rise buildings, industrial and commercial premises, petrol stations and power stations to certain domestic properties. It is crucial firefighters and incident commanders know exactly what firefighter risks are identified and what firefighting actions are required. In addition, firefighters and incident commanders need to know which engineered solutions such as ventilation, fire alarm systems, rising mains, water supply, fire hydrants and evacuation strategies are in place and how to use them tactically to deal effectively with an incident.

ESFRS’s previous manual SSRI process meant crews assessing the risk at premises had to make handwritten notes, fill out a Word document and then send an email to their respective Station Manager for approval. This was prior to the SSRI document being uploaded manually to a SSRI system and downloaded to the services’ Mobile Data Terminals (MDT), located on each fire appliance, for use when in transit and at incidents. This process could take up to seven days to complete.

## The Solution

ESFRS identified this process needed upgrading to meet aspects of the Grenfell Tower incident recommendations and to modernise the technology in use, and reached out to their ICT managed service provider and trusted partner, Telent, to help them kickstart the process.

With the support of strategic partners, Telent have been working with ESFRS since 2016 to transform key operational processes. In this instance, commercial, out-of-the-box solutions were available – but ESFRS and Telent felt that a purpose-built, configurable solution would be better placed to meet all requirements and deliver maximum impact and improve safety.

Telent introduced Tisski, a Node4 company, to ESFRS and what they had set out to achieve, and together we mapped a way forward for the organisation. The end solution would support ESFRS’s digital strategy, with a focus on alignment of digital risk data collection and current guidance, and the introduction of an auditable digital process for collecting and communicating risk data.


## The Results

- Simplified and digitised SSRI process
- Mobile app created for gathering information onsite 
- Decreased times for sharing vital information
- Improved risk analysis and reporting 


### From 7 days to 5 minutes – a 99.9% reduction in time

As part of the project, ESFRS wanted to create a desktop-based risk assessment tool (electronic form) that would simplify and digitise the SSRI process. With Tisski on board, the process was built inside ESFRS’s Microsoft Dynamics CRM system. A companion app version of the process was also created using Microsoft Power Apps which allows crews and inspectors to go on-site with a mobile device, enter key information, amend risk information and take pictures. This would enable the information captured to be synchronised directly with the central Dynamics CRM system, prompting distribution to the MDT terminals on each fire appliance. With the information no longer sitting in limbo waiting to be uploaded manually, information is available within five minutes as it is updated for all firefighters and commanders, should they need it in the event of an emergency.

Each SSRI has an associated risk score, calculated based on all the relevant factors found at the premises. This labels a property risk to firefighters as very low, medium, high or very high risk. This level of risk allocated through the risk assessment tool does influence the level of, and frequency of, risk familiarisation activity for crews and commanders. With approval workflows built into the process, this enables monitoring of the submission of SSRI assessments; a building that retains a risk status will have its assessment automatically approved. If a risk level has increased or decreased, the SSRI assessment will be put forward for a Station Manager or Group Manager to give the final sign off.

At the fire station, a list of SSRI visits for the day ahead synchronises to a tablet from the central Microsoft Dynamics CRM system either via Wi-Fi or mobile signal. Once on the road, if the operational member of staff finds themselves with no mobile signal, the information is contained in offline mode, meaning the information can still be completed and saved. The information is submitted and synchronised with the central CRM system once a mobile or Wi-Fi signal has been regained.

Derek Hamilton said: “The tablet app has been developed by Tisski using Microsoft Power Apps and deployed by Telent. It is particularly important to the ESFRS teams as we cover many rural areas. The information being available offline where there is no mobile signal was essential.”

### Technology that really makes a difference

With the introduction of this new technology, ESFRS will benefit from improved risk analysis, reporting and enhanced risk information being immediately available to improve safety of crews and efficient resolution of incidents.

Mark Matthews, Assistant Chief Fire Officer at East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, said: “With Tisski and Telent’s combined technical expertise, we could see exactly what we could achieve by modernising our processes. Working in life-threatening situations daily, it’s important that we are working as quickly and efficiently as possible – Tisski have been invaluable in helping us deliver a change in technology that really makes a difference.”

Barry Zielinski, Operations and Services Director at Telent, said: “This solution clearly demonstrates the value of the long-term relationship and deep understanding we have with the team at East Sussex. We take real pride in enabling the digital transformation of these key processes, replacing paper forms to improve efficiency and ensure that latest risk information is available within minutes.”


# West Midlands Police force


West Midlands Police Force is the UK’s second-largest police force. It covers an area of almost 350 square miles and serves around 3 million people. The force deals with more than 2,000 emergency calls each day while also patrolling the streets and responding to incidents. West Midlands Police established its digital forensics team in 2003 to help officers deal with an increasing volume of digital evidence.

It’s estimated that 90% of UK crimes have a digital footprint, and the team’s task is to sort that data into actionable intelligence. Today, the digital forensics team’s services are a vital crimefighting tool across the West Midlands and Warwickshire, covering all areas of criminal activity but with a strong focus on investigating and prosecuting child exploitation and abuse.

## The Challenge

The digital forensics team relied on on-premises IT infrastructure. But with per-case data volumes routinely passing the four terabytes mark and multiple cases on the go at any one time, they struggled to manage the necessary IT infrastructure, such as physical storage, processing power and SQL databases. Plus, the team was acutely aware of their responsibility to ensure their data was secure and managed to policing standards. However, their biggest concern was that data analysis had become very time-consuming, with a growing number of devices requiring analysis and investigation on each case.    

“If you go back 10 or 20 years, the vast majority of people would have had one phone in the house and probably one PC,” explains West Midlands Police’s Digital Forensics/Incident Response Supervisor, Detective Sergeant John Price KPM, who has been recognised for his leadership and innovation on the 2024 New Years Honours list with the King’s Police Medal for Digital Forensics. “Today, when we enter a suspect’s house, most have a work phone, a personal phone, tablets, and laptops. Plus, there are doorbells, dashcams, body cams, car cams, security cameras, smart TVs, game consoles and a whole load of other internet-enabled devices that record data and could be potential evidence or exhibits.”


## The Solution


Knowing the digital forensics team couldn’t continue with its on-premises IT infrastructure, West Midlands Police turned to Node4 for assistance. With regular input from the detective and other key stakeholders within the West Midlands Police Force, Node4 — in partnership with Microsoft and Exterro — built and delivered the first instance of FTK Central in a Microsoft Azure environment and the UK’s first cloud-based digital forensics analysis solution.

FTK Central processes data on seized devices, building links between different exhibits and enabling concurrent investigations that lead to faster convictions. Node4 manages the day-to-day running of the Microsoft Azure infrastructure and ensures all gathered data is stored in compliance with policing and wider data protection standards. FTK Central went live with 50 users and, so far, has been instrumental in processing data for 550 cases.

FTK was originally designed as an on-premises solution and Exterro deployed it as such in multiple sites across the USA. However, for the first time, West Midlands Police’s FTK installation operates in the public cloud using Microsoft Azure infrastructure services, including autoscaling, network provisioning, firewalls, and virtual machines. This was made possible by Node4’s unique combination of Microsoft Azure technical knowledge and deep understanding of IT requirements across the country’s police forces. As part of Node4’s role as systems integrator on the project, the company also established the Azure tenancy, and built and designed the virtual machines, networking components, and created the security and governance environment.

Once the Microsoft Azure environment was up and running, Node4 handed the virtual machines over to Exterro so that the FTK toolkit could be installed. With a repeatable public cloud template for FTK now established, the intention is to draw on Node4’s relationships with the majority of UK police forces and offer it to those without a digital forensics capability.


## The ResultS

- Saves Critical Time
- Compliant with digital data storage and management regulations
- Dramatically speeds up investigations — cases that once took months now take weeks
- Ability to scale up or down when data requirements change



Officers can now log into the analysis platform from their station and review all exhibit data in situ instead of travelling to the digital forensic team’s offices — saving critical time and resources and dramatically speeding up investigations. 

“When you understand that around 75% of the cases we handle deal with indecent images of children, you can see why speed and accuracy are so important,” explains DS Price KPM. “We are often the ones who identify abuse of children and vulnerable persons and then work with the appropriate team to help safeguard victims — even before we move to detain perpetrators. Using this tool, cases that once took months now take weeks. Those that took days can be solved in hours. As such, I can categorically say that the solution has safeguarded children and other vulnerable victims and kept them from further harm.” 

Node4’s solution helps West Midlands Police Force comply with the regulations governing how it stores and manages digital data. This includes ISO17025 2017, which sets out standards for holding and dealing with exhibits. It’s also compliant with the Forensic Science Regulators Act and adheres to Management of Police Information (MOPI) standards. Node4 also monitors all existing regulations and, when necessary, adjusts storage policies within its managed cloud environment — removing worries about compliance management from the team’s daily to-do list.  

“You can imagine, with the data we’re dealing with, trust between us and our managed services provider is imperative,” notes DS Price KPM. “We explained our data management and security requirements to Node4 upfront, which were then built into the framework.”

From an administrative and budgetary standpoint, moving to the cloud has given the digital forensics team the elasticity to scale when data requirements increase. It also allows the team to pull back on capacity when the demand is not so great. This helps keep departmental IT-related costs down and enables the team to work at the same fast pace, regardless of the number of cases or data volume.

DS Price KPM concludes: “There’s an honest passion from the Node4 team to get this right for us. Their support has been superb throughout the design and roll-out process, with team members going consistently above and beyond. They understand the importance of our work and the intensity and urgency that drives our department. And they’ve delivered the tools and framework that allow us to work quickly, accurately and professionally to protect some of society’s most vulnerable people.”
