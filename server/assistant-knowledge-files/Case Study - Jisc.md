# Jisc
Jisc is a not for profit organisation that provides technology solutions and services for the UK’s education and research sectors.

Jisc is best known for its Janet network, which is used by approximately 18 million people across the UK for research and education.


## The Challenge

In 2018, Jisc upgraded its core finance system to a solution based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. “We needed to be able to access more system functionality than our existing configuration allowed,” recalls Anne Marie Gregory, Jisc’s Director of Finance Transformation. “. We were unable to access some core solution functionality and had to continue with many manual processes that we thought could be automated. It was a very frustrating time for us as we weren’t where we wanted to be.”

- Limited Access
- Lack of Automation
- Low Functionality
- Security at Scale needed


She continues: “But the biggest issue was that our configuration was using a single-entity ledger, even though Jisc is a multi-entity organisation. This fundamental element was key to our decision to reimplement the solution entirely. At that point, we put out a tender, which Node4 won, standing out from the crowd regarding their detailed, considered response. We were particularly impressed with Node4’s data security knowledge. This was particularly relevant to us, as our security infrastructure is of utmost importance.”  



## The Solution

As a top priority, Node4 fully integrated Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations with one of Jisc’s other IT systems. This enabled the solution to operate—as intended—as a unified platform that can automate operations, enhance decision making and drive growth.

Following the reimplementation, the solution also provides Jisc with the appropriate multi-entity structure to facilitate recording all financial transactions for each legal entity in the group. In addition, it simplifies sales invoicing and payment processes, provides appropriate internal and external visibility of customer account transactions and reduces the need for time-consuming manual searches.

“We can now run automated daily bank reconciliations,” says Anne Marie. “We have reduced our debtor days and can now supply our credit control team with more timely information, empowering them to do their job more effectively. Our month-end reporting is much more efficient, too, as we can report directly from the system rather than depending on third-party generated reports. Overall, we’re much more confident about the accuracy of our automated reports—particularly the most complex inter-company ones.”  

## The Results

- More Effiecient
The new system’s accessibility significantly enhances data management efficiency across the organisation. Users can easily input and extract data from the application, regardless of their location, allowing more time for analysis and making critical, real-time decisions based on the insights gained.

- More control
With functions moved over from third-party software, Jisc has more control over its data and reporting structure along with unified training for all tools with less exposure to cybersecurity threats.

- Time-saving reduction
A task which would have typically taken days has now been reduced to minutes thanks to new abilities to automate manual tasks. Employees can now create faster and more accurate reports instantly with PowerBi.
