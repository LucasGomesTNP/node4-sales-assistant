# Datalex

Datalex is a leading provider of cutting-edge digital transformation to companies such as Aer Lingus, Air China, EasyJet and JetBlue, creating differentiation and leadership in the digital retail space. Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, the business has custom built software offerings for airlines, supported by around 250 employees, with a turnover of more than €20 million in 2022.

## The Challenge

Datalex were struggling to calculate the cost of employees and contractors through disparate systems. The month-end process was taking more than twenty days to complete. Paired with an unresponsive and difficult partner, they needed to investigate a new solution and a new partner to take them forward.

**Initial exposure to Business Central and challenges**

In January 2020, they planned their upgrade to Business Central and began their journey through a Business Central implementation of version 16, replacing their old accounting system Exchequer. Business Central was chosen for its flexibility and customisability through extensions technology.

The core Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution was implemented by an Irish partner, but further development to the system failed in 2021. Datalex wanted to add custom development for timesheet complexity to Dynamics 365 Business Central to calculate the cost for customers, projects and resources. The cost of development charged by the original partner had been over and above what they had expected for the time required. Communications had grown poor with their partner.

## Solution

TNP takes on the ERP development

In 2021, Datalex’s Head of Data Analytics, David de la Vega, reached out to a recommended contact who was now employed by TNP. Brendan Doyle, TNP Commercial Lead, was delighted to help and swiftly ensured that they had a safe home with TNP. 

### Moving forward

Datalex are working towards an upgrade to Business Central Online, Microsoft’s SaaS version of the product and TNP are on hand to assist. The benefits of upgrading include:

    The latest functionality.
    An array of available APIs to connect external systems into Business Central.
    An easier to maintain and upgraded platform.
    And world-class security from Microsoft.

There is also the 40% discount from Microsoft on licences when upgrading to Business Central, which helps to make a significant saving. This offer is called ‘Bridge to the Cloud’ and registration for the initiative must be completed before 31st December 2024. Datalex will also save on the hosting costs, as their new Business Central system will be looked after by Microsoft in the cloud, with the hosting costs absorbed into the monthly subscription.
